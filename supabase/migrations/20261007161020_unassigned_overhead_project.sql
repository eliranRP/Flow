-- FLOW-102. An unassigned bucket and an overhead project, so a company's
-- projects, overhead, and unassigned lines add up to its total. Decision 0101.

comment on column public.companies.overhead_project_id is
  'A project whose project-filed expense lines count as overhead, not direct cost. Null means none. Decision 0101.';

-- pnl_role reads 'overhead' for a project-role expense line filed to the overhead project, so
-- every P&L read moves it from direct to overhead. unassigned marks an income line
-- with no project, and an expense line with no role or a project role and no project.
