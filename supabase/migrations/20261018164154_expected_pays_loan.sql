-- expected_months names a recurring charge that pays a loan ('pays_loan'): any of the charge's lines
-- has loan_splits parts. Its usual amount is the whole payment (principal, interest and escrow), so a
-- profit forecast leaves it out and counts the loan's profit parts in their own categories instead.
-- The rest of the definition is the current one, unchanged. Signature and grants are unchanged.
